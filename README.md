# Car-Number-Plates-Detection-And-Number-Extraction
ðŸ›‘ Automatic Number Plate Detection and Text Extraction
This Python project uses OpenCV, Haar Cascade, and Tesseract OCR to detect vehicle number plates from an uploaded image and extract the text written on the plate. A simple GUI is built using Tkinter to interact with the tool.

ðŸš€ Features
Upload an image of a vehicle.
